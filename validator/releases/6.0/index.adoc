=== Bean Validation 2.0

Hibernate Validator 6.0 is the Reference Implementation of the Bean Validation 2.0 specification so it comes with all its new features:

 * First class support of container element constraints and cascaded validation (think `private Map<@Valid @NotNull OrderCategory, List<@Valid @NotNull Order>> orderByCategories;`);
 * Support for the new JSR 310 date/time data types for `@Past` and `@Future`;
 * New built-in constraints: `@Positive`, `@PositiveOrZero`, `@Negative`, `@NegativeOrZero`, `@PastOrPresent` and `@FutureOrPresent`

We also have leveraged the new features of JDK 8 (built-in constraints are marked repeatable, parameter names are retrieved via reflection) as it is now the minimal version required.

=== Other new features

 * http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#constraint-validator-payload[Constraint validator payload]: ability to pass a payload to your constraint validators
 * Additional constraints: `@ISBN`, `@UniqueElements` and `@CodePointLength`
 * http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-clock-provider[Temporal validation tolerance]
 * `ScriptEvaluatorFactory` SPI: ability to support non JSR 223 scripting languages such as Spring EL

=== Performance improvements

We have done quite a lot of benchmarking and have significantly improved the performances of Hibernate Validator.

It can be https://in.relation.to/2018/03/20/bean-validation-benchmark-rerevisited/[up to four times faster] than Hibernate Validator 5.4.2.Final in some cases.

=== Memory footprint improvements

Hibernate Validator collects a lot of metadata on the constrained beans. We reduced significantly the memory occupied by these metadata.
