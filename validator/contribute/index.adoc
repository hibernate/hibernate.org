You want to implement a new validation feature or you found a bug and want to provide a fix? Awesome!
The following gets you started.

== Requirements

* JDK 8 (use >=1.8.0_20)
* http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] (at least version 3.0.3)

== Getting the source

The Hibernate Validator code is available on http://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator[GitHub]. To get a read only version of the source you can use:

[source]
----
git clone git://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator.git validator
----

For people with write access:

[source]
----
git clone git@github.com:hibernate/hibernate-validator.git validator
----

To contribute back to Hibernate Validator you should create a http://help.github.com/forking[fork] of the project into your GitHub account and submit http://help.github.com/pull-requests/[pull requests] with your changes. For more information on Git, check out http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/HibernateMovesToGitGitTipsAndTricks[this blog entry].

For those interested, the HV legacy code base (3.x) can be accessed under the https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/tree/pre-validator3-removal[pre-validator3-removal] tag.

The source code of the Bean Validation API (of which Hibernate Validator >= 4.x is the reference implementation) can be retrieved via

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/beanvalidation/beanvalidation-api
----

Finally there is the Bean Validation TCK (test compatibility kit) which can be checked out via

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/beanvalidation/beanvalidation-tck
----

== Hibernate Validator modules

The Hibernate Validator code base comes in form of a http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER/Multi-modules+projects[multi-module] Maven project, comprising the following modules:

* *annotation-processor*: the HV annotation processor for checking correctness of constraints at compile time
* *build-config*: the configuration for the build of HV
* *cdi*: the CDI portable extension
* *distribution*: builds the released HV distribution package
* *documentation*: builds the HV reference guide
* *engine*: the core validation engine
* *integration*: in-container integration tests
* *modules*: creates HV modules patches to be applied for HV module upgrades in WildFly
* *osgi*: the HV OSGi modules aggregator. Contains HV features for Apache Karaf and OSGi integration tests submodules
* *performance*: a performance test suite based on JMeter
* *tck-runner*: executes the Bean Validation TCK against HV
* *test-utils*: Test utility methods and annotations used across several modules

== Building from Source

=== Compiling and testing

Prior to setting the project up in any IDE it is recommended to trigger a command line build to verify that everything builds. Just run:

[source]
----
mvn clean install
----

This will download all dependencies and compile and test each module.

=== Build options

There are several options/properties available to control the build. The following options might be useful to speed up the build time. Per default everything gets built!

==== Skipping parts of the build

The build of the distribution bundle (_distribution_) can be skipped via the _disableDistributionBuild_ property:

[source]
----
mvn install -DdisableDistributionBuild=true
----

The build of the _documentation_ module can be skipped via the _disableDocumentationBuild_ property:

[source]
----
mvn install -DdisableDocumentationBuild=true
----

==== Deploying sources and javadocs jars as part of local install or snapshot deploy

In case you want the sources and javadocs jar installed as part of the build (either on a local install or a SNAPSHOT deploy) specify `-DperformRelease=true`.

[source]
----
mvn -DperformRelease=true clean [install|deploy]
----

See also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4725668/how-to-deploy-snapshot-with-sources-and-javadoc[this SO post].

==== Staging Maven Release locally

Sometimes it is convenient to go through the Maven release steps without actually deploying anything.
This makes sure the release and deploy plugins work as expected. You can also re-build a release
from an existing tag this way.

[source]
----
mvn release:stage -DconnectionUrl=scm:git:git://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator.git -Dtag=<tag> -DstagingRepository=staging::default::file:///<fully-qualified-path-to-deploy-dir>
----

=== Writing and building the documentation

The documentation is written in http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[Asciidoc] and can be found in
the _documentation_ module of your checkout. http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] is used to
transform the Asciidoc sources to their target formats. The http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference[Asciidoc syntax quick reference] helps you to get started with the syntax. You can
build the documentation by executing:

[source]
----
mvn package -pl documentation
----

== IDE Setup

[TIP]
====
We recommend to trigger a command line build prior to importing into the IDE. This way the generated
sources (in our case JAXB binding classes generated via the jaxb2-maven-plugin) are available
and can be picked up by the IDE.
====

=== Eclipse

Eclipse is able to import a Maven project (like Hibernate Validator) without needing plugins.
To import the project in Eclipse just follow these steps:

1. Go to the menu: +File > Import > Existing Maven projects+
2. Select all the projects and +Advance > Name template > [artifactId]-[version]+
3. Run the maven build from the root folder: project 'hibernate-validator-parent' +Run as > Maven install+
4. When the build is completed, refresh the workspace
5. the environment JavaSE-1.8 to use JDK 1.8

=== IDEA

IntelliJ IDEA come with built-in support for multi module Maven projects. Just import your project
as Maven project. We recommend the following options:

image::hv-maven-import-options-idea.png["Maven import options",align="center"]

In particular +Exclude build directory+ should be unchecked, so that the generated JAXB resources
are automatically added to the IDE module configuration.

=== Code style

Hibernate Validator is using code style common to all Hibernate projects. Configuration xml files
for Eclipse and IDEA, with detailed instructions on how to import the styles in your IDE can be found
https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ide-codestyles[here].

=== Running TCK tests

Running the Bean Validation TCK tests in the IDE can be a little tedious. One way is the following (should work in the same way in Eclipse as well as IDEA):

* Create a new TestNG test configuration
* Select the _Suite_ option
* Select _tck-runner/target/dependency/beanvalidation-tck-tests-suite.xml_ as suite file. The Maven build extracts the suite file from the JSR TCK jar and places it into this directory
* Specify the following VM options (you need to set the same properties as set by the Maven build, see _pom.xml_) :

[source]
----
-Dvalidation.provider=org.hibernate.validator.HibernateValidator
-DexcludeIntegrationTests=true
----

* Select the _hibernate-validator-tck-runner_ module as the project (Eclipse) or module to obtain the classpath from (IDEA).

All the steps are summarized in the screen-shot below (using IDEA):

image::tck-jsr-349-setup.png["TCK runner set-up",align="center"]

If you run this test configuration all TCK tests are getting executed. You can just edit the suite file to change which tests you want to run, e.g.:

[source]
----
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "http://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd" >

<suite name="JSR-380-TCK" verbose="1">
    <test name="JSR-380-TCK">
        ...
        <classes>
           <class name="org.hibernate.beanvalidation.tck.tests.validation.ValidateTest"/>
        </classes>

    </test>
</suite>
----

More information about how to configure the TestNG suite file can be found http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#testng-xml[here].

== Coding Guidelines

=== General

Refer to the Hibernate https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-17951[design philosophy] when working
on new HV features.

Make sure to add the following license header to all newly created source files:

[source]
----
/*
 * Hibernate Validator, declare and validate application constraints
 *
 * License: Apache License, Version 2.0
 * See the license.txt file in the root directory or <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>.
 */
----

=== JavaDoc

The following conventions should be followed when working on the Hibernate Validator code base:

* Use `{@code}` instead of `<code>`, because it is more readable and `{@code}` also escapes meta characters
* `@param`, `@return` and `@throw` don't end with a '.'; the first word starts with a lower-case letter
* If referring to other classes and methods of the library, use `{@link}`
* `{@link}` might be use for external classes, `{@code}` is accepted, too
* Use `<ul/>` for enumerations (not '-')
* Use the code style template mentioned above to format the code

=== Providing a patch

Patches including a test and fix for an issue are always welcome, preferably as GitHub pull request. We are following the _Fork + Pull Model_ as described http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests[here].
In oder to be able to integrate your patch you have to accept the https://cla.jboss.org/[JBoss Contributor License Agreement]!
