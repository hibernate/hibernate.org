Hibernate Reactive is community driven.
As such the roadmap constantly evolves to reflect the users needs.
Dates are generally omitted, we release when we are ready.

== Hibernate Reactive 1.0

The initial release already supports most features of Hibernate ORM,
including:

* Almost every operation of the `Session` and `StatelessSession` APIs
* Almost every ORM mapping annotation except for `@ManyToMany`
* HQL, native SQL, and `Criteria` queries
* All association fetching strategies
* Statement batching
* Sequence, table, identity, and custom identifier generation
* Resource-local transactions
* Optimistic and pessimistic locking
* Local second-level cache
* Custom connection management and multitenancy
* Automatic schema export
* Choice of `CompletionStage` or link:https://smallrye.io/smallrye-mutiny/[Mutiny]-based APIs
* Integration with Hibernate Validator, Hibernate JPA metamodel generator, Query Validator,
  and the Hibernate bytecode enhancer
* Integration with Quarkus

The following databases are supported via the Vert.x 3 client library:

* Db2, MySQL, and PostgreSQL

We're working on the following missing features:

* `@ManyToMany`
* Hi/lo (block) identifier generation
* Support for SQL Server via the Vert.x 4 client library
