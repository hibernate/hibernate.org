This document will guide you through the ways of website edition.

== TL;DR

Wanna start hacking right away? This section is for you.

Look at the `search` directory for inspiration in content, structure and markup examples.

To start a new project, for example ORM, do the following:

. create the project directory `mkdir orm`
. copy the pages from search `cp -R search/ orm`
. create a project section in `_config/site.yml` under `projects`.
.. best is to simply copy the search subsection and update the data
.. the project section name is lowercase and corresponds to the URL path (`search` and not `hibernate-search`)
. edit the pages (*.haml, *.adoc) under `orm/` and replace the `project` or `awestruct-project` attribute to the lowercase project name

== Prerequisites

Follow the link:/README{outfilesuffix}[README] instructions to get Awestruct and its dependencies up and running.

== How to edit

Use your favorite editor, for example +vim+.
All pages are using text based markups with various degrees of flexibility and readability.
Indentation is two spaces.

CAUTION: In Ruby indentation matters, be careful.

=== Live reload (optional)

You can make the editing/reviewing work-flow faster by using the
livereload plugin in your browser.

. Install the appropriate http://livereload.com/extensions/[live reload plugin].
. Start `guard` (in separate terminal from the root of the repository checkout)
+
[source]
----
bundle exec guard
----

Every time you save a file, the web page will be automatically reloaded assuming you have activated the browser plugin.

== Add a page

There are two types of pages, http://haml.info[HAML] based (`\*.html.haml`) and http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[Asciidoc] (`*.adoc`).

HAML::
HAML is close to HTML and let's you use Ruby. Use this when you need special layouts in your page or use the site metadata.
In general, only super users should use them.
Asciidoc::
Asciidoc is a markup language close to Markdown but more powerful. When you start a page, prefer this format.
The best resource to learn the Asciidoc syntax are http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[the writer guide] and http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[the syntax quick reference].

[TIP]
.Best of both worlds?
====
You can embed Asciidoc fragments inside a haml page.

      And now I'm back in plain Asciidoc with http://example.com[links] and all.
  -# Back in HAML, notice the indentation
  .span6
----
====

A file named `downloads.html.haml` or `downloads.adoc` in the `search` directory will generate `/search/downloads/index.html` that we reference as `/search/downloads/` at it makes for nicer URLs. If you plan to create several pages under the `download/` path, create the `download` directory and add `search/downloads/index.html.haml` or `search/downloads/index.adoc`.

=== Page attributes

Each page has some metadata attributes associated and put at the top of the file.

# note that the first block in haml should be surrounded by `---` and not `----`

        === Full-text search for entities

        Offers full-text search support for objects stored by Hibernate ORM, Infinispan and other sources.
        Think of it as Google(tm) for your entities:

        * search words with text
        * order results by relevance
        * find by approximation (fuzzy search)

You've got a question burning you? We might have the answer for you.

== Indexes

=== No file created in index directory

Hibernate Search won't create a new index in existing directories.
....

Here is a list of the most useful attributes.

layout (or awestruct-layout in Asciidoc)::
Represents the layout the page will use. Layouts are present in the `_layout` directory
title::
The page title.
+
[NOTE]
====
The page title of an Asciidoc file is the text in the first line following `=`.

----
= Some title
:some-attribute: value

Preamble (usually bigger)

== First section

Some text.
----
====
project (or awestruct-project)::
Optional. Represents the project the page descrcibes. Used to properly compute navigation.
Mandatory if the page is under the project subdirectory.
toc (Asciidoc only)::
Optional. Enable the rendering of the table of content in Asciidoc documents
toc-placement (Asciidoc only)::
Mandatory if `toc` is used. On this website, the table of content position is imposed and defined in css.
Just set the value to _preamble_.
toc-title (Asciidoc only)::
Optional. Defines the table of content title. Defaults to _Table of content_.
numbered (Asciidoc only)::
Number the sections and the ToC.

=== List of layouts

Layouts are used to share the same site structure. They can be nested.
All are in the `_layouts` directory.
There are a few important layouts:

* `project` (`project.html.haml`): structure of a generic page (we will change the name in a little while)
* `project-frame` (`project/project-frame.html.haml`): structure of a project specific page. All files under `search`, `orm`, `validator` etc. use this layout
* `title-nocol` (`common/title-nocol.html.haml`): structure of a generic page with a title and no column. Useful for generic Asciidoc pages like this one.
* `project-releases` (`project/project-releases.html.haml`): structure of the `/releases/` page of each project.
* `project-releases-series` (`project/project-releases-series.html.haml`): structure of series-specific pages of each project (e.g. `/search/5.8/`).
* `project-documentation` (`project/project-documentation.html.haml`): structure of the `/documentation/` page of each project (except ORM).

=== Partials

Partials (in the `_partials` directory) are page fragments that can be reused from within a haml page or layout.

CAUTION: Partials do not get automatically refreshed when change. You need to stop, clean and restart Awestruct `rake clean preview`.

== Update releases

=== Add a new release

To add a release, you will need to add a release file in the `_data` directory.
The file will have to be named `<full version number>.yml` (for example `5.8.0.Final.yml`)
and be located in `_data/<project ID>/releases/<series version>/`.

CAUTION: You should never remove the files related to previous releases:
they are used to generate links to all JIRA tickets of a given series, for instance.

If your release is the first one of a new series, you will also have to create a new `series.yml` file
in the `_data/<project ID>/releases/<series version>` directory.

For information about the content of each file, see <<data_directory,here>>.

=== Older/end-of-life'd series

To mark a series as end-of-life (no longer maintained) and display the corresponding warnings,
edit the `_data/<project ID>/releases/<series version>/series.yml` file
to set the `endoflife` attribute to `true` (just add the attribute if it is missing).

By default, an end-of-life'd series is considered "older" and not displayed with the other series:
it is not displayed in the drop-down "Releases" submenu,
it is moved to its own "Older series" section in the page listing all series,
and it is not displayed in the project's compatibility matrix.

You can override this behavior, to hide a non-EOL'd series or display an EOL'd series,
by editing the `_data/<project ID>/releases/<series version>/series.yml` file
and setting the `displayed` attribute to `true` or `false` (just add the attribute if it is missing).

=== Hide a specific release

To hide an older series, edit the `_data/<project ID>/releases/<series version>/<release version>.yml` file
to set the `displayed` attribute to `false` (just add the attribute if it is missing).

To only hide download links and Maven coordinates,
set the `available` attribute to `false` (just add the attribute if it is missing).

== Data

=== `_config/site.yml`

The `site.yml` file contains site-related, YAML-formatted data.

This includes some project-related data.

See the file for more information about available attributes.

[[data_directory]]
=== `_data`

The `_data` directory contains YAML-formatted data for the releases of each project.

The structure of this directory is as follows:

* <project ID, e.g. `search`>
** `releases`
*** <series version, e.g. `5.8`>
**** `series.yml` (data about the series)
**** <one file for each release in this series, e.g. `5.8.0.Final.yml`>

The `series.yml` file may contain the following attributes:

* Mandatory:
** `summary`: a short text (one or two sentences) summarizing the specifics of this series.
* Optional:
** `displayed`: `true` to display the series on hibernate.org, `false` to hide it.
   Defaults to `false`.
** `displayed`: whether this series should be displayed. Defaults to false.
** `artifacts`: an array of objects, one object for each Maven artifact	. Each object has the following attributes:
*** `artifact_id`: the Maven artifact ID
*** `group_id`: the Maven group ID. Optional: defaults to the group ID defined on the series, or on the project.
*** `summary`: a short text (6/7 words at most) summarizing the purpose of this artifact
** `integration_constraints`: a map, with keys being the integration IDs defined in `site.yml`,
   and values being objects with a `version` attribute describing the version constraints summarily (about a dozen characters).

The `<release>.yml` files must be named after the release version (e.g. `5.6.0.Final.yml`)
and may contain the following attributes:

* Mandatory:
** `date`: the date of the release. Format is yyyy-mm-dd
** `stable`: `true` for stable releases (`*.Final`),
   `false` for development releases (alpha, betas, CRs, ...)
* Optional:
** `announcement_url`: the URL of the blog post announcing the release
** `summary`: a one-sentence summary of the content of the release
** `displayed`: `true` to display the release on hibernate.org, `false` to hide it.
   Defaults to `true`. Note that a release will only be displayed if its series is displayed.

[[staging]]
== Preview changes on staging.hibernate.org

Use git to push your changes to the
link:https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate.org/tree/staging[staging branch]
on link:https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate.org[GitHub].

The staging site can be used for various experiments with the site L&F and content.
For this reason, ou might need to use `git push --force` to overwrite previous experiments.

// staging.hibernate.org is not rendered as URL to limit the crawling
// TODO create a noindex in robots.txt for non production profiles

Pushing changes to the
link:https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate.org/tree/staging[staging branch]
will trigger the link:https://ci.hibernate.org/view/Website/job/staging.hibernate.org/[staging.hibernate.org]
job on the Hibernate link:https://ci.hibernate.org[CI Server]. The content of
staging.hibernate.org will be automatically updated as part of a successful
build.

[[publishing]]
== Publish changes to hibernate.org

Use git to push your changes to the
link:https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate.org/tree/production[production branch] of the
repository on link:https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate.org[GitHub].

[NOTE]
====
When adding a new release to the site, one needs to make sure that the release artifacts
are already published. Part of the site generation is to parse the release metadata from
the release POM. If the artifact is not yet published an error will occur!
====

Your changes need to be a fast forward of the link:https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate.org/tree/production[production branch]. Never use the `--force` option in this case!
If you have a push error, rebase first and possibly repeat the <<staging,staging>> phase.

Pushing changes to the
link:https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate.org/tree/production[production branch]
will trigger the link:https://ci.hibernate.org/view/Website/job/www.hibernate.org/[www.hibernate.org]
job on the Hibernate link:https://ci.hibernate.org[CI Server]. The content of
link:http://hibernate.org[hibernate.org] will be automatically updated as a result
of a successful build.
