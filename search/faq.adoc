You've got a question burning you? We might have the answer.

== Indexes

=== No file created in index directory

Hibernate Search won't create a new index in existing directories.

The fundamental Lucene index files are created at framework startup, but existing directories are not modified.
Delete the directory: the framework will create it and build the basic index structure at startup.
Since 3.1 it detects indexes in existing directories automatically.

=== In a cluster, my nodes don't seem to see each other index changes

The problems can be rather different but mostly likely configuration based.
Make sure to review carefully the configuration chapter of the reference documentation.

A common problem is to forgot to disable the exclusive index option.

[source]
----
hibernate.search.[default|<indexname>].exclusive_index_use false
----

This option defaults to true as it vastly improves performance for non clustered environments.

== Queries

=== Can I mix HQL and Lucene queries?

This is not possible as there is no way to intersect the results from both queries without iterating on at least one of the results.
You may consider adding additional fields to the Lucene index and then look at the Filters in the reference documentation.

=== Avoid two queries when retrieving results and size

If you plan to return the number of matching results and the list of results, you should call the methods in the following order

[source,java]
----
fullTextQuery.list(); //or iterate or scroll
fullTextQuery.getResultSize();
----

This will execute a single Lucene query instead of two and will be faster.

== Configuration

=== I get an error message saying Event listeners are not configured

The full error message looks something like this:

----
Caused by: org.hibernate.HibernateException: Hibernate Search Event listeners not configured, please check the reference documentation and the application's hibernate.cfg.xml
   at org.hibernate.search.util.ContextHelper.getSearchFactoryBySFI(ContextHelper.java:32) 
----
 
There are several possibilities for this error.

* You are not using Hibernate Annotations in which case the event listeners have to be manually configured (see also the event listener configuration in the online documentation):
+
[source,xml]
----
<hibernate-configuration>
     <session-factory>
        <event type="post-update"/>
            <listener class="org.hibernate.search.event.FullTextIndexEventListener"/>
        </event>
        <event type="post-insert"/>
            <listener class="org.hibernate.search.event.FullTextIndexEventListener"/>
        </event>
        <event type="post-delete"/>
            <listener class="org.hibernate.search.event.FullTextIndexEventListener"/>
        </event>
    </session-factory>
</hibernate-configuration>
----
+
TIP: Other versions require more event listeners, and latest versions don't require any at all: please refer to the documentation relevant to the version you are using.

* Your are using the wrong version of Hibernate Annotation/Search.
+
Hibernate Annotation tries to detect Search at startup and configures the event listeners in case they are found.
This however requires that you have the right versions of the dependencies.
Check the Compatibility Matrix for the right combination of jar files.
In case you are using the jar files which ship with the Hibernate Search distribution make sure that you really installed the right jar files and they they are really used.
Some containers might have a shared lib directory with a older versions of the required libraries. Check the log file.
Each Hibernate product reports its version when starting up.
* If you sure you are using the right version of Annotations and Search and you still get this exception it might be that you have a custom class loading configuration which prevents Annotations to locate the Search specific event listeners.
If this is the case try the manual configuration.

=== How do I get started with the search archetype?

Use the following command, specifying the latest Hibernate Search version for archetypeVersion (or the version of your choice):

[source]
----
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.hibernate -DarchetypeArtifactId=hibernate-search-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=4.0.0.Final -DarchetypeRepository=http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public-jboss/
----

You need to specify the group id, artifact id and a version.
Once the sample project is created you can inspect the sources and run for exmaple mvn test.

To get a full list of available archetypes in the repo run:

[source]
----
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeRepository=http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public-jboss
----

== Integration

=== +NoSuchMethodError+ in JBoss AS 4.2

The error is: `Caused by: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.hibernate.search.FullTextSession.createFullTextQuery(Lorg/apache/lucene/search/Query;[Ljava/lang/Class;)Lorg/hibernate/search/FullTextQuery;`

Hibernate Search 3.0 requires Hibernate Annotations 3.3.x and JBoss AS 4.2 ships with 3.2.x. Replace the following jars:

* hibernate-annotations.jar (3.3.x for Search 3.0)
* hibernate-validator.jar (3.0.x for Search 3.0)
* hibernate-entitymanager.jar (3.3.x for Search 3.0)
* hibernate-commons-annotations.jar (3.0.x for Search 3.0)

in `[JBOSS_HOME]/server/[myconfig]/lib`.
Then place Hibernate Search and Lucene JARs in your EAR or WAR.

=== I am using Spring and the index is not being updated at transaction commit

See also http://www.hibernate.org/441.html[spring integration] and especially check you're using the correct transaction manager:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="transactionManager" class="org.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager">
----

=== How do I properly shutdown Search?

Search is using background threads to manage the indexes; they are gracefully closed when you close Hibernate's +SessionFactory+.
Closing the +SessionFactory+ is always recommended; when using Search it's mandatory, otherwise your application might never terminate.

[source,java]
----
sessionFactory.close();
----

When using `exclusive_index_use=true` it's also needed to properly clear the index locks; note that this options is enabled by default since Hibernate Search 4.0.
