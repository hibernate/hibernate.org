Hibernate Search is community driven and as such the roadmap constantly evolves to reflect the users needs.
You can find a finer grained roadmap in our https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH[issue tracker] but this page is a good and concise view of where we are going.
Dates are generally omitted: while milestones are released regularly, the Final release is tagged when it's stable.

== Hibernate Search 5.0

Based on link:$$http://lucene.apache.org/core/$$[Apache Lucene] version 4, which will lead to some compatibility breaks over the Hibernate Search 4.x series.

Apache Lucene 4.x::
Move to link:$$http://lucene.apache.org/core/$$[Apache Lucene] 4.x. This is a significant departure and is the cause of most compatibility breaks.
Speed and feature improvements will flow from this migration.
Dynamic type indexing::
Rather than focusing on statically annotated entities we'll also provide more flexible "schema" definitions.
Uncommitted changes in a transaction::
Expose uncommitted changes to queries run in the current transaction.
Classloader SPI::
Explicit classloader SPI for better EAP integration as modules.
API / SPI for alternative backends::
Define API / SPI abstraction to allow for future external backends integrations
such as link:$$http://lucene.apache.org/solr/$$[Apache Solr] and link:$$http://www.elasticsearch.org/$$[Elastic Search].
Asynchronous FieldBridge::
ex. improved integration with link:$$http://tika.apache.org/$$[Apache Tika].
Performance regression tests::
Add more and better performance regression tests.


== Hibernate Search  5.1

CDI integration::
Offer a portable extension to help integrate in CDI.
Better clustering::
Solid Infinispan and JGroups integration, ease of setup.
Jandex::
Use Jandex for annotation scanning for faster boot in both JavaSE and in http://wildfly.org[WildFly].
High performance backend queues::
Low contention non blocking queues.
Automated performance regression tests::
'nuf said.
New Faceting engine::
link:$$http://lucene.apache.org/core/$$[Apache Lucene] 4 based faceting engine for better performance.
Auto suggestion and spell checking::
Simplify work for users building auto suggestions and spell checking features.
New quickstart and demo::
Quickstarts and demos for link:$$http://www.jboss.org/jdf/$$[JBoss Developer Framework].


== Hibernate Search 5.2

Pre-analysis of text in the transaction context::
Better remoting/clustering & scalability.
Hibernate ORM 5.x / JPA 2.1 / Java EE 7::
Provides compatibility with link:/orm/[Hibernate ORM 5.0].
Might need to be pushed earlier to match Hibernate ORM 5 plans.
