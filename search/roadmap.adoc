Hibernate Search is a community driven project and as such the roadmap constantly evolves to reflect the users needs.

You can find a finer grained roadmap in our https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH[issue tracker] but this page is a good and concise view of where we are going.

Dates are generally omitted: while milestones are released regularly, the Final release is tagged when it's considered stable.


== Hibernate Search 5.6

Experimental integration with Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch::
This version will sport an experimental integration with Elasticsearch, and aim at providing a reasonably useful
integration without breaking public APIs.
Performance::
Having now a robust integration with Apache Lucene 5.x, even though current performance is good we want
to make sure we're making the most of it.


== Hibernate Search 5.7

Improved modularity

WildFly Swarm::
WildFly Swarm is the new fine-grained modular version of WildFly aiming at microservices.
We should make sure Hibernate Search is integrated properly and the usage is documented.
Java 9 compatibibility::
We're aiming at regularly testing compatibility with Java 7, 8 and now 9 too.
Hibernate Search should test its modularity within project Jigsaw, within reason as we can't depent on Java9 release schedules.
Pre-analysis of text in the transaction context::
We will explore the option to compute the text analysis on the slave nodes, to improve remoting/clustering & scalability.
Removing this step from the master nodes will eventually allow to have "indexing only" nodes which don't need to have entities deployed.
Clustering::
The integration of a "master node" needs to be simplified, both in terms of user configuration and implementation.
We plan to not need user classes (entities) on such a node, so that in future it could be a separate download
which works out of the box with minimal configuration.


== Hibernate Search 6.x

API refresh to better match all new features from Lucene 5 and 6, free-form indexing and the new backends
such as Elasticsearch and standalone cluster nodes.

Upgrade to Apache Lucene 6::
To provide the full power of some of the new features in Apache Lucene 6, some API changes are needed. This includes some API improvements which could have been useful since the upgrade to Lucene 5, but we only apply breaking API changes in major releases.
Better integration for new backends::
The new integrations such as the Elasticsearch support will also benefit from a better fitting API.
Free-form indexing::
We're planning to decouple the metadata definition from annotated java classes, to allow better indexing of other more flexible sources.
Join operations::
Expose Lucene's index-time and query-time join capabilities.
