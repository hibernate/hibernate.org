== Hibernate Search Eclipse plugins

There is an https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/hibernate-search-plugin[Eclipse plugin for Hibernate Search] which helps
to inspect the Lucene index and prototype queries.

The plugin was made as a feature of https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-hibernate[jbosstools-hibernate plugin], which can be http://tools.jboss.org/downloads/[downloaded] and installed on its own or together with the full JBoss Tools distribution.
After that you can install the Hibernate Search plugin via the Eclipse Marketplace.

== Luke

https://github.com/DmitryKey/luke/[Luke] is an excellent standalone tool to inspect Apache Lucene indexes, and also prototype queries.

Compared to the Eclipse tooling, this offers more features but it's not specific to Hibernate Search; it's closer to be a tool
for Apache Lucene power users.
