This page contains documentation for current and future maintainers of Hibernate Search.

== Releasing

=== Prepare the release

* Check that everything has been pushed to the upstream repository.
* Check that the CI job for the branch you want to release is green.
* Check there are no outstanding issues in JIRA.
* If you **added a new Maven module** that should be included in the distribution,
**check that it has been included in the distribution** (javadoc and ZIP distribution).
** `mvn clean install -Pdocumentation-pdf,dist`
** Check the distribution package as built by Maven (distribution/target/hibernate-search-<version>-dist).
In particular, check the jar files in the subdirectories:
+
*** `lib/required`
*** `lib/optional`
*** `lib/provided`

+
+
They should contain the appropriate dependencies, without duplicates.
The creation of these directories is driven by the assembly plugin (distribution/src/main/assembly/dist.xml)
which is very specific and might break with the inclusion of new dependencies.

=== Perform the release

Once you trigger the CI job, it automatically pushes artifacts to the
https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories[OSSRH repository manager],
the distribution to https://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-search/[SourceForge]
and the documentation to https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/[docs.jboss.org].

* Transfer the released issues in JIRA to the "Closed state".
** Go to https://hibernate.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20HSEARCH%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Resolved%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%205.7.2.Final[this search]
** Select another "fixVersion".
** Click the button with three dots on the top right corner of the screen and click "Bulk update all XX issues".
** Use the "Transition" action to transition your issues from "Resolved" to "Closed",
and please uncheck the option near the bottom "Send email notifications".
* Release the https://hibernate.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/project-config/HSEARCH/versions[version on JIRA].
* Do *not* update the changelog.txt and README.md, the release job does it for you.
* Trigger the release on the CI
** Go to CI, to https://ci.hibernate.org/job/hibernate-search/[the "hibernate-search" CI job].
** Click the "run" button (the green triangle on top of a clock, to the right) next to the branch you want to release.
** **Be careful** when filling the form with the build parameters.
* Release the artifacts on the https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories[OSSRH repository manager].
** Log into Nexus. The credentials can be found the team's document.
** Use the search box to hide all unrelated repositories:
searching for "hibernate" will show only the ones created by hibernate-ci.
** Examine your staging repository
** If necessary, test the release in the staging repository.
** If there is a problem, drop the staging repo, fix the problem, delete the commits pushed by CI and the tag
(Note: they have been pushed upstream by CI).
** If everything is ok, select the staging repository and click the "Release" button.
*** For Search 5.x and below, you will also need to "Close" the repository before you can release it.
*** Click "Refresh" after each action.

=== Announce

* Update https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate.org[hibernate.org]:
** If it is a new major or minor release, add a `_data/projects/search/releases/series.yml` file
and a `search/releases/<version>/index.adoc` file.
** Add a new YAML release file to `_data/projects/search/releases`.
** Depending on which series you want to have displayed,
make sure to adjust the displayed flag of the series.yml file of the old series.
** **If it's a `.CR` or `.Final` release**:
*** Update the http://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/[Migration Guide];
in particular, check the git history for API/SPI changes
and document them in the migration guide.
** **If it's a Final release**:
*** Don't forget to add a line containing `stable: true` to the new YAML release file.
** Push to the production branch.
* Blog about release on https://in.relation.to/[in.relation.to].
Make sure to use the tags "Hibernate Search" and "Releases" for the blog entry.
* Send an email to hibernate-announce and CC hibernate-dev.
* Tweet about the release via @Hibernate.
Try to engage with the Lucene community or other communities depending on the release highlights.
* Update our forum's https://discourse.hibernate.org/t/latest-hibernate-search-version-5-8-2-final/26/3[sticky post].

=== Update depending projects

If you just released the latest stable, you will need to update other projects:

* Upgrade the Hibernate Search dependency
in the https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-test-case-templates/tree/master/search[test case templates].
* Upgrade the Hibernate Search dependency
in the https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-demos/tree/master/hibernate-search[demos].
* If not already done, create a maintenance branch for the previous series:
** `mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=x.(y-1).z-SNAPSHOT`
** `git add`, `commit`, `push upstream` the new branch.
** Activate github's "branch protection" features on the newly created maintenance branch
https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-search/settings/branches/.

Additionally, you should make sure to keep the `previous.stable` property in the POM up-to-date
on all actively developped branches.
The property must point to the latest micro of the previous minor.
E.g. let's say you release 5.6.5 while being actively working on 5.7.
Then the development branch for 5.7 must have its `previous.stable` property set to 5.6.5.
