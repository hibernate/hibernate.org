Here we are helping you migrate your existing Hibernate Search application to the latest and greatest.

== Upgrade to Hibernate Search 5.0.0.Final

The aim of this guide is to assist you migrating an existing Hibernate Search 4 application to
Hibernate Search 5.

NOTE: This document provides pointers for a migration.
It refers to Hibernate Search 5.0.0.Final.
If you think something is missing or something does not work, please link:/community[contact us].
If you're looking to migrate different versions see link:/search/documentation/migrate[Hibernate Search migration guides].

=== Requirements

The most important upfront. Hibernate Search 5 requires now Java 7. Support for Java 6 has been dropped.

Hibernate Search 5 also builds now upon Lucene 4 (more specifically
link:http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_10_2/index.html[4.10.2]). If you are using any
native Lucene APIs make sure to align with this version. Refer also to the
link:https://lucene.apache.org/core/4_10_2/MIGRATE.html[Lucene Migration Guide].

Hibernate Search is compatible with link:/orm[Hibernate ORM] 4.3.7.Final and
link:http://infinispan.org/[Infinispan] 7.0.2.Final.

=== API changes

Even though the Lucene API changes between version 3 and 4 are rather big, we were able to hide most
of the complexities behind the Hibernate Search API. Some changes, however, trickle all the way through.

==== Sorting query results

Lucene's `SortField` API has changed. Instead of

[source,java]
----
fulltextQuery.setSort( new Sort( new SortField( "title", SortField.STRING ) ) );
----

you now need to use:

[source,java]
----
fulltextQuery.setSort( new Sort( new SortField( "title", SortField.Type.STRING ) ) );
----

=== Class re-names and re-locations

Between Hibernate Search 4 and 5 several classes have changes names or package. This happened within
the Search API as well as within the Lucene API. The following is a list of the most important changes.

==== Within Hibernate Search

* `SearchFactory` was moved from the module `hibernate-search-engine` to `hibernate-search-orm` as
it should only be used by the ORM integration. Other integrators should depend exclusively on `SearchIntegrator` (former `SearchFactoryIntegrator`)
* The following classes got re-located:
** `org.hibernate.search.engine.impl.SearchMappingBuilder` => +
`org.hibernate.search.engine.spi.SearchMappingBuilder`
** `org.hibernate.search.Environment` => +
`org.hibernate.search.cfg.Environment`
** `org.hibernate.search.FullTextFilter` => +
`org.hibernate.search.filter.FullTextFilter`
** `org.hibernate.search.indexes.impl.DirectoryBasedIndexManager` => +
`org.hibernate.search.indexes.spi.DirectoryBasedIndexManager`
** `org.hibernate.search.infinispan.impl.InfinispanDirectoryProvider` => +
`org.hibernate.search.infinispan.spi.InfinispanDirectoryProvider`
** `org.hibernate.search.ProjectionConstants` => +
`org.hibernate.search.engine.ProjectionConstants`
** `org.hibernate.search.SearchException` => +
`org.hibernate.search.exception.SearchException`
** `org.hibernate.search.spi.MassIndexerFactory` => +
`org.hibernate.search.batchindexing.spi.MassIndexerFactory`
** `org.hibernate.search.spi.SearchFactoryBuilder` => +
`org.hibernate.search.spi.SearchIntegratorBuilder`
** `org.hibernate.search.spi.SearchFactoryIntegrator` => +
`org.hibernate.search.spi.SearchIntegrator`
** `org.hibernate.search.Version` => +
`org.hibernate.search.engine.Version`
* The enum value `SpatialMode.GRID` was renamed to `SpatialMode.HASH`

==== Within Apache Lucene

* Lucene's `QueryParser` changed package from `org.apache.lucene.queryParser.QueryParser` to
`org.apache.lucene.queryparser.classic.QueryParser`
* Many popular `Analyzer`, `TokenFilter` and `CharFilter` classes moved. Refer to the
link:http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_10_2/[Lucene API docs] to find the appropriate replacement.
* Solr utilities classes, for example
`link:http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_10_2/analyzers-common/org/apache/lucene/analysis/util/TokenizerFactory.html[TokenizerFactory]` or
`link:http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_10_2/analyzers-common/org/apache/lucene/analysis/util/TokenFilterFactory.html[TokenFilterFactory]`,
were moved into Apache Lucene. For this reason we could remove the dependency to Apache Solr.
Good news is a simplified dependency graph! The bad news, if you depend on some of these utilities
or custom analyzers, you'll need to find the new (package) name

=== Mapping

==== Id fields of embedded relations no longer indexed by default

When using an `@IndexedEmbedded` annotation to include fields from a related entity, we would include the 'id' of the related entity.
These 'id' fields are no longer included by default, but you can enable the inclusion by using the `includeEmbeddedObjectId` attribute of  the `@IndexedEmbedded` annotation.

[source,java]
----
@IndexedEmbedded(includeEmbeddedObjectId=true)
----

==== Number and date index format

Numbers and dates now indexed as numeric fields by default.

Properties of type `Date`, `Calendar` as well as `int`, `long`, `float`, `double` and their corresponding
wrappers, are no longer indexed as strings. Instead, they are now indexed using Lucene's appropriate
numeric encoding.

The 'id' fields are an exception to this rule: even when these are represented by a numeric type, they will still be indexed as a string keyword by default.

TIP: `Date` and `Calendar` instances are encoded as `long` value representing the number of
milliseconds since _January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT_.

TIP: The use of `@NumericField` becomes now obsolete, unless you want to specify a custom precision
for the numeric encoding.

You can still keep the old (string based) index format by explicitly specifying a string encoding
field bridge. In the case of integers for example
`link:http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.0/api/org/hibernate/search/bridge/builtin/IntegerBridge.html[org.hibernate.search.bridge.builtin.IntegerBridge]`.
Check the package `link:http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.0/api/org/hibernate/search/bridge/builtin/package-summary.html[org.hibernate.search.bridge.builtin]` for
other publicly available field bridges.

For dates and calendars you can switch the indexing format via the new
`link:http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.0/api/org/hibernate/search/annotations/EncodingType.html[EncodingType]`
enum, for example `@DateBridge(encoding=EncodingType.STRING)` resp.
`@CalendarBridge(encoding=EncodingType.STRING)`.

IMPORTANT: The change of encoding for number and dates is probably the most important user facing
change. If you have any query which targets a previously string encoded field, but
is not encoded numerically, you will need to update the query. Numeric fields must be searched with
a `link:https://lucene.apache.org/core/3_0_3/api/core/org/apache/lucene/search/NumericRangeQuery.html[NumericRangeQuery]` (if you are using the Search query DSL, the right query should be created for
you). Also make sure that all fields targeted by faceting need for now be string encoded.

=== Misc

==== FullTextIndexEventListener now final

`FullTextIndexEventListener` is now a final class. If you are extending this class, you need to
find an alternative approach for what you want to achieve. Maybe you can use an
`EntityIndexingInterceptor`? If you cannot find a way to implement your use case
- link:/community[contact us].

==== hibernate-search-analyzers module removed

The module _hibernate-search-analyzers_ was dropped from the repository and will no longer be
included in upcoming release. It is obsolete and we recommend to depend on the appropriate
Lucene artifact directly, for example _org.apache.lucene:lucene-analyzers-common_.

==== JMS controller API changed

The JMS backend was depending to link:/orm[Hibernate ORM]. This dependency was removed, so that the
backend can be used in other (non ORM) environments as well. A consequence is that implementors of
`org.hibernate.search.backend.impl.jms.AbstractJMSHibernateSearchController` will need to adjust to
the new signature. This class is really considered internal. We suggest to take this class as an
example instead of extending it.

==== ServiceRegistry API updated

The `org.hibernate.search.engine.service.spi.Service` SPI got refactored. If you where integrating
with the old service contract, refer to the javadoc of
`link:http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.0/api/org/hibernate/search/engine/service/spi/ServiceManager.html[ServiceManager]`,
`link:http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.0/api/org/hibernate/search/engine/service/spi/Service.html[Service]`,
`link:http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.0/api/org/hibernate/search/engine/service/spi/Startable.html[Startable]`
and `link:http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.0/api/org/hibernate/search/engine/service/spi/Stoppable.html[Stoppable]`
for details about the new contract.
