Here we are helping you migrate your existing Search application to the latest and greatest.

== Upgrade to Search {to_version_short}.x from {from_version_short}.x

The aim of this guide is to assist you migrating an existing application using any version `{from_version_short}.x` of Hibernate Search to the latest of the `{to_version_short}.x` series.
If you're looking to migrate different versions see link:/search/documentation/migrate[Hibernate Search migration guides].

NOTE: This document provides pointers for a migration.
It refers to Hibernate Search version `{reference_version_full}`. If you think something is missing or something does not work, please link:/community[contact us].

=== Requirements

This version of Hibernate Search now requires using Hibernate ORM version `5.2.x`.

=== API changes

There were no relevant API changes within Hibernate Search itself; consider though that the required Hibernate ORM version change may change some Hibernate ORM APIs.
