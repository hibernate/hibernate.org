Here we are helping you migrate your existing Search application to the latest and greatest.

== Upgrade to Hibernate Search {to_version_short}.x from {from_version_short}.x

The aim of this guide is to assist you migrating an existing application using any version `{from_version_short}.x` of Hibernate Search to the latest of the `{to_version_short}.x` series.
If you're looking to migrate different versions see link:/search/documentation/migrate[Hibernate Search migration guides].

NOTE: This document provides pointers for a migration.
It refers to Hibernate Search version `{reference_version_full}`. If you think something is missing or something does not work, please link:/community[contact us].

=== Requirements

The basic requirements didn't change.

=== Configuration changes

`hibernate.search.index_uninverting_allowed` now defaults to `false`,
resulting in exceptions being thrown when you attempt to sort on a field that hasn't been marked with `@SortableField`,
instead of simply logging a warning.

A new request timeout, set to 60s by default, has been added:
`hibernate.search.default.elasticsearch.request_timeout`.
If you execute requests taking more than 60s, you will have to raise this timeout,
as well as the others (socket timeout, ...).
See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.8/reference/en-US/html_single/#elasticsearch-integration-configuration[the documentation]
for more information.

Index schema management strategy options in the Elasticsearch integration
have been renamed to be more in line with the similar JPA options:

 * `none` stays the same
 * `validate` stays the same
 * `merge` is now `update`
 * `create` stays the same
 * `recreate` is now `drop-and-create`
 * `recreate-delete` is now `drop-and-create-and-drop`

The `ram` directory provider has been renamed to `local-heap`.
The `ram` name still works, but will be removed in a future version.

Pretty-printing of JSON in logs is now disabled by default.
It can be enabled using the configuration option
`hibernate.search.elasticsearch.log.json_pretty_printing`.

=== API changes

Below are the changes on application programming interfaces that require changes on the existing implementations or clients.
Please refer to the javadoc for the expected behavior of changed/added methods.

`org.hibernate.search.jpa.FullTextQuery`, `org.hibernate.search.FullTextQuery`, `org.hibernate.search.jpa.FullTextEntityManager`, `org.hibernate.search.FullTextSession`:

 * Internal changes related to merging the JPA implementations with the native ones
   may result in some differences in the type of exceptions being thrown.
   If you have specific exception handling code around full-text query execution,
   you may want to test it again.
   See https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-search/commit/38fc9b864e6a279eccb84a15c14002dce61df4fa[this commit message]
   for more information.
 * `FullTextEntityManager#getDelegate()` now returns the actual delegate
   (it used to return the delegate's delegate).

Full-text filters:

 * `.filterBy()` in the query DSL now accepts any `org.apache.lucene.search.Query` instance,
   and not to just `org.apache.lucene.search.Filter` instances.
 * Full-text filters can now be implemented with any `org.apache.lucene.search.Query` instance,
   and do not limit you to using only `org.apache.lucene.search.Filter` instances.
 * Since the `org.apache.lucene.search.Filter` type is deprecated in Lucene
   and will ultimately be removed,
   you are encouraged to move away from using it.

Analyzer definition providers:

 * Interfaces of analyzer definition providers moved since they were first introduced as experimental concepts.
   Their new locations are:
 ** `org.hibernate.search.analyzer.definition.LuceneAnalysisDefinitionProvider`
 ** `org.hibernate.search.elasticsearch.analyzer.definition.ElasticsearchAnalysisDefinitionProvider`

Sortable fields:

 * Sort fields are now expected to either be assigned a normalizer,
   or to not be analyzed at all.
   You can find out more about normalizers in the reference documentation:
 ** https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.8/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-normalizers[main documentation]
 ** https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.8/reference/en-US/html_single/#_normalizers[Elasticsearch specifics]

`@DynamicBoost`, `@Boost`:

 * Index-time boosting capabilities have been deprecated.
   Index-time boosting will not be possible anymore starting from Lucene 7.
   You should use query-time boosting instead, for instance by calling
   `org.hibernate.search.query.dsl.FieldCustomization#boostedTo(float)`
   when building queries with the Hibernate Search query DSL.

`org.hibernate.search.annotations.Parameter`:

 * Using multiple `@Parameter` with the same name in the same array of parameters
   will now trigger an exception.

Please also note those new features that may help when writing new code, but don't require any change to existing code:

 * `.must()` / `.should` in the `QueryBuilder` now accept (and ignore) `null` queries.
 * `QueryBuilder` now offers a new `queryString` method,
   allowing to execute queries written by end users in a controlled way.
   See https://in.relation.to/2017/04/27/simple-query-string-what-about-it/[this blog post]
   for more information.
 * `FullTextSession.unwrap( FullTextSession.class )` now works correctly
   (it used to throw an exception).

=== SPI changes

Below are the changes on service provider interfaces that require changes on the existing implementations or clients.
Please refer to the javadoc for the expected behavior of changed/added methods.

General changes:

 * `org.hibernate.search.spi.IndexedTypeIdentifier` is now used throughout our SPIs
   to refer to indexed types instead of `java.lang.Class`.
   Many methods accepting or returning `Class` have been replaced
   with new versions accepting or returning `IndexedTypeIdentifier`.
   If you use `DeleteByQueryWork`, you might need to convert a `Class<?>` to an `IndexedTypeIdentifier`:
   in that case, use `searchIntegrator.getIndexBindings().keyFromPojoType( myClass )`.

`org.hibernate.search.backend.spi.BackendQueueProcessor`:

 * Backends are now expected to plug into Hibernate Search by registering a `org.hibernate.search.backend.spi.Backend` service,
   instead of a `org.hibernate.search.backend.spi.BackendQueueProcessor`.
   The backend will then create the queue processors when requested.
   The previous mechanism of registering a `org.hibernate.search.backend.spi.BackendQueueProcessor`
   is still supported, but has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

`org.hibernate.search.query.engine.spi.HSQuery`:

 * the `filter(Filter)` method is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
   Use a full-text filter instead, or handle filtering using boolean junctions when building the query.
 * the `targetedTypes` methods have been removed.
   Target type information should now be passed when creating the query.

`org.hibernate.search.spi.SearchIntegrator`:

 * the deprecated `createHSQuery()` method has been removed. Use `createHSQuery(Query, Class...)` instead.

`org.hibernate.search.spi.BuildContext`:

 * the deprecated `getIndexingStrategy()` method has been removed in favor of `getIndexingMode()`.

`org.hibernate.search.spi.SearchIntegratorBuilder`:

 * the deprecated `getIndexingStrategy()` method has been removed in favor of `getIndexingMode()`.

`org.hibernate.search.spi.SearchFactoryBuilder`:

 * this interface has been removed in favor of `org.hibernate.search.spi.SearchIntegratorBuilder`.

`org.hibernate.search.spi.SearchFactoryIntegrator`:

 * this interface has been removed in favor of `org.hibernate.search.spi.SearchIntegrator`.

The changes below are unlikely to impact anyone, but are mentioned here for the sake of completeness.

`org.hibernate.search.indexes.spi.IndexManagerType`:

 * `getMissingValueStrategy()` has been replaced with
   `createMissingValueStrategy(ServiceManager serviceManager, SearchConfiguration cfg)`.

`org.hibernate.search.query.engine.spi.QueryDescriptor`:

 * `createHSQuery(SearchIntegrator)` has been removed
 * a new method `createHSQuery(SearchIntegrator, IndexedTypeSet)` has been added.
 * a new method `createHSQuery(SearchIntegrator, List<CustomTypeMetadata>)` has been added.

`org.hibernate.search.engine.spi.EntityIndexBinding`:

 * `getSelectionStrategy()` has been replaced with `getIndexManagerSelector()`
 * `getIndexManagers()` has been removed. Use `getIndexManagerSelector().all()` instead.

`org.hibernate.search.engine.spi.AbstractDocumentBuilder`:

 * `getMetadata()` has been removed in favor of `getTypeMetadata()`.
 * `close()` has been removed.

`org.hibernate.search.analyzer.spi.AnalyzerStrategy`:

 * a new method `createProvidedAnalyzerReferences()` has been added.
 * `initializeAnalyzerReferences(Collection, Map)` has been replaced with
  `void initializeAnalyzerReferences(Collection, Map, Collection, Map)`.
 * a new method `createProvidedNormalizerReferences()` has been added.
 * a new method `createNamedNormalizerReference(String)` has been added.
 * a new method `createLuceneClassNormalizerReference(String)` has been added.

`org.hibernate.search.analyzer.spi.ScopedAnalyzerReference`:

 * `getAnalyzer()` has been removed.

`org.hibernate.search.analyzer.spi.ScopedAnalyzer`:

 * this class has been removed.

`org.hibernate.search.analyzer.spi.AnalyzerReference`:

 * `getAnalyzer()` has been removed.
 * a new method `isNormalizer(String)` has been added.

`org.hibernate.search.store.spi.DirectoryHelper`:

 * `getVerifiedIndexDir(String, Properties, boolean)` has been removed

`org.hibernate.search.store.spi.LockFactoryCreator`:

 * `createLockFactory` now expects a `Path` instead of a `File`.
