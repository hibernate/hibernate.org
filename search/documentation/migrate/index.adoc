If you're upgrading from older versions, please migrate to _4.5.3.Final_ first.

== Hibernate Search versions 3 and 4

Details to migrate from and between the various releases of Hibernate Search _3.x_ and _4.x_ are documented on our previous https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/HibernateSearchMigrationGuide[migration guide wiki].
Please note these versions are no longer maintained, so migrating to a more recent _5.x_ version is a very good idea.
