=== Dependency upgrades

[[java-version]]
Java::
Hibernate Search is now using JDK 11 as a baseline and can work on JDK 11, 17 or 21.
Compatibility with JDK 8 was dropped.
[[orm-version]]
Hibernate ORM::
Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 6.4 as it fully switched to Jakarta EE.
There are no `-orm6`/`-jakarta` artifacts or Java EE compatibility anymore.
[[lucene-version]]
Lucene::
The Lucene backend now uses Lucene 9.8.
Upgrading requires reindexing, see the migration guide for details.
[[elasticsearch-version]]
Elasticsearch::
The Elasticsearch backend works with Elasticsearch 8.10/8.11/8.12 as well as other versions that were already compatible --
except for the following versions whose compatibility was dropped, because they already reached their end of life:
* 5.x/6.x
* 7.0-7.9
[[opensearch-version]]
OpenSearch::
The Elasticsearch backend works with OpenSearch 2.10 and 2.11 as well as other versions that were already compatible --
except for versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 whose compatibility was dropped,
because they already reached their end of life.

[[hibernate-search-bom]]
=== Hibernate Search BOM

Hibernate Search now offers a BOM providing dependency management for all of its published artifacts.
It can be imported as part of your dependency management to keep the versions of Hibernate Search artifacts aligned:

[source, XML, indent=0, subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <!-- Import Hibernate Search BOM to get all of its artifact versions aligned: -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-search-bom</artifactId>
            <version>{latest-release-version}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
        <!-- Any other dependency management entries -->
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
<!-- ... -->
<dependencies>
    <!-- Declare dependencies -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId>
        <artifactId>hibernate-search-mapper-orm</artifactId>
        <!-- The version is managed by the BOM above -->
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId>
        <artifactId>hibernate-search-backend-elasticsearch</artifactId>
        <!-- The version is managed by the BOM above -->
    </dependency>
    <!-- Any other dependency entries -->
</dependencies>
----

[[aws-opensearch-serverless]]
=== Amazon OpenSearch Serverless experimental compatibility

Hibernate Search now has incubating compatibility with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless.

Amazon OpenSearch Serverless has certain limitations compared to a regular OpenSearch cluster
and link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/serverless-genref.html[may not support all operations] a regular cluster does.
Compatibility with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless must be enabled explicitly by setting the backend version property:

[source, properties, indent=0]
----
hibernate.search.backend.version=amazon-opensearch-serverless
----

See link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#backend-elasticsearch-compatibility-amazon-opensearch-serverless[this section of the reference documentation]
for more information, in particular about limitations.

[[orm-discriminator-multi-tenancy]]
=== Compatibility with Hibernate ORM's discriminator-based multi-tenancy

Hibernate Search can now index Hibernate ORM entities
that take advantage of
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.3/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#multitenacy-hibernate-TenantId[discriminator-based multi-tenancy in the database (`@TenandId`)].

[[renamings]]
=== Maven artifact renamings

Some Hibernate Search Maven artifacts have been renamed:

* Maven artifacts related to JSR-352 artifacts were renamed to reflect the move to the Jakarta EE specification:
** `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-core` was renamed to `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-jakarta-batch-core`.
** `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-jberet` was renamed to `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-jakarta-batch-jberet`.
* The artifact `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-coordination-outbox-polling`
was renamed to `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-outbox-polling`.
