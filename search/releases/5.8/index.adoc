[[elasticsearch-5]]
=== Elasticsearch 5.x support

Hibernate Search now integrates with Elasticsearch 5.x.

The new driver is backwards compatible, so we'll still be able to connect to
clusters running Elasticsearch `2.x`.

This doesn't need any configuration flag as Hibernate Search can automatically
detect the version of Elasticsearch it's being pointed to.

The features supported by Elasticsearch `5.x` and `2.x` are however slightly
different and you'll find that some low level mapping features are documented
as compatible with only one specific version.

Also, due to major changes in Elasticsearch 5, migration from 2 to 5
(as well as from 5.0/5.1 to 5.2 in certain conditions)
will require full reindexing.
The migration guide will be updated when this minor release will be feature
complete.

[[new-elasticsearch-client]]
=== New improved Elasticsearch client

This release now uses the new Elasticsearch REST client, which is expected to
be a safe choice in terms of long term maintenance as it's sponsored and
recommended by the Elasticsearch team.

Compared to the driver we used previously, this one uses a state of the art
reactive architecture, so we can take advantage of more efficient resource
utilization.

[[simple-query-string]]
=== New `Simple Query String` supported by the Query builder DSL

The useful capabilities from Lucene's `SimpleQueryParser` are now conveniently
exposed by our higher level DSL.

Details about this feature are available https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.8/reference/en-US/html_single/#_simple_query_string_queries[in the documentation],
and also https://in.relation.to/2017/04/27/simple-query-string-what-about-it/[in this blog post].

[[simplified-jndi-configuration]]
=== Simplified JNDI configuration

If you integrated any external component into Hibernate Search using JNDI,
for example a JMS queue or an Infinispan cache, this configuration was simplified.

You will no longer need to set Hibernate Search specific configuration
properties such as how to set the `InitialContext` for JNDI lookups:
only configure Hibernate ORM, and Hibernate Search will inherit the same
settings.

See also the http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.2/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#jndi[JNDI configuration in the Hibernate ORM documentation].

[[analyzer-providers]]
=== Programmatic analyzer definitions

You can now define your analyzers programmatically (without annotations),
globally (without putting the definition on a particular entity),
and in a native way (without using Lucene classes to configure an Elasticsearch analyzer)
using analyzer definition providers.

For example, for Lucene your `LuceneAnalysisDefinitionProvider` might look like this:

[source, JAVA]
----
public static class CustomAnalyzerProvider implements LuceneAnalysisDefinitionProvider {
    @Override
    public void register(LuceneAnalyzerDefinitionRegistryBuilder builder) {
        builder
                .analyzer( "myAnalyzer" )
                        .tokenizer( StandardTokenizerFactory.class )
                        .charFilter( MappingCharFilterFactory.class )
                                .param( "mapping", "org/hibernate/search/test/analyzer/mapping-chars.properties" )
                        .tokenFilter( ASCIIFoldingFilterFactory.class )
                        .tokenFilter( LowerCaseFilterFactory.class )
                        .tokenFilter( StopFilterFactory.class )
                                .param( "mapping", "org/hibernate/search/test/analyzer/stoplist.properties" )
                                .param( "ignoreCase", "true" );
    }
}
----

While for Elasticsearch you would have:

[source, JAVA]
----
public static class CustomAnalyzerProvider implements ElasticsearchAnalysisDefinitionProvider {
    @Override
    public void register(ElasticsearchAnalysisDefinitionRegistryBuilder builder) {
        builder.analyzer( "tweet_analyzer" )
                .withTokenizer( "whitespace" )
                .withCharFilters( "custom_html_strip" )
                .withCharFilters( "p_br_as_space" );
        
        builder.charFilter( "custom_html_strip" )
                .type( "html_strip" )
                .param( "escaped_tags", "br", "p" );

        builder.charFilter( "p_br_as_space" )
                .type( "pattern_replace" )
                .param( "pattern", "<p/?>|<br/?>" )
                .param( "replacement", " " )
                .param( "tags", "CASE_INSENSITIVE" );
    }
}
----

As you can see, this allows you to avoid needing to refer to Lucene classes to configure Elasticsearch analyzers. 
 
More details can be found 
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.8/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-programmatic-analyzer-definition[here for Lucene]
and https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.8/reference/en-US/html_single/#_custom_analyzers_using_a_definition_provider[here for Elasticsearch].

[[normalizers]]
=== Normalizers for safer sorts

In https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2726[HSEARCH-2726]
and https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2659[HSEARCH-2659] we introduced normalizers:
analyzers that do not perform any kind of tokenization.

We shamelessly borrowed this concept from Elasticsearch, but implemented it in both embedded Lucene mode and Elasticsearch mode.
Normalizers are useful for sortable fields: when a field is sortable it should never be tokenized, as this would make the sort order unpredictable;
the sort could apply to the first token if you're lucky, but it could be applied on any other token.

From version 5.8.0.Beta3 onwards, Hibernate Search will log warnings whenever you're using an analyzer on a sortable field.
To resolve this warning change your Analyzer definition to be a Normalizer.

In Lucene, normalizers are just here to help, they work exactly as analyzers.
The two differences are that you can't affect a tokenizer to a normalizer when defining it,
and that normalizers have a runtime safety net: should you manage to create multiple tokens,
Hibernate Search will concatenate them back to a single token and log a warning.

In Elasticsearch version 5.2 and above, a normalizer will be translated to a native Elasticsearch normalizer,
and a text field with a normalizer will take the `keyword` datatype.

In Elasticsearch version 5.1 and below, native normalizers are not available,
thus normalizers are simply translated to analyzers
and a text field with a normalizer will take the `text` (5.x) or `string` (2.x) datatype.

You can find out more about normalizers in the reference documentation:

 * https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.8/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-normalizers[main documentation]
 * https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.8/reference/en-US/html_single/#_normalizers[Elasticsearch specifics]

[[aws-integration]]
=== AWS integration

We added a new module allowing you to very simply wire your Hibernate Search instance
to an AWS-hosted Elasticsearch cluster using Amazon's proprietary IAM authentication mechanism. 

You can find more information about how to use this integration in the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.8/reference/en-US/html_single/#elasticsearch-integration-configuration-aws[reference documentation].

[[bean-resolver]]
=== Dependency injection in FieldBridges

As part of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1316[HSEARCH-1316],
we're experimenting with integration with various dependency injection frameworks.

The integration is about allowing you to use annotations such as `@Inject`,
`@PostConstruct` and so on in your FieldBridges,
which may for example allow you to fetch additional data
from your application when indexing a given bean.

Integration is currently known to work with Spring DI and CDI.
We don't provide packages for user consumption,
but if you are an integrator, or simply if you feel like it,
you can have a look at our integration tests:
