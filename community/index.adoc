[questions]
== Ask questions & find answers

If you have a question regarding one of our projects, the following resources will help you
finding the answer:

Documentation::
Best to first check the documentation. Yes it sounds boring, but knowing a tool makes the difference.
+++<br />
<div class="ui labels blue">
<a class="ui label" href="/orm/documentation/"><i class="icon book"></i>ORM</a>
<a class="ui label" href="/search/documentation/"><i class="icon book"></i>Search</a>
<a class="ui label" href="/validator/documentation/"><i class="icon book"></i>Validator</a>
<a class="ui label" href="/reactive/documentation/"><i class="icon book"></i>Reactive</a>
<a class="ui label" href="http://tools.jboss.org/documentation/"><i class="icon book"></i>Tools</a>
</div>
+++

https://stackoverflow.com/[Stack Overflow]::
After the documentation, probably the best place to look for answers. We actively monitor the following tags:
+++<br />
<div class="ui labels blue">
<a class="ui label" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hibernate">hibernate</a>
<a class="ui label" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hibernate-search">hibernate-search</a>
<a class="ui label" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hibernate-validator">hibernate-validator</a>
<a class="ui label" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hibernate-reactive">hibernate-reactive</a>
<a class="ui label" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hibernate-tools">hibernate-tools</a>
</div>
+++

https://discourse.hibernate.org[Forum]::
If your question doesn't fit the Stack Overflow format, our forum is here for you. Come join us and discuss! We have a category for each project:
+++<br />
<div class="ui labels blue">
<a class="ui label" href="https://discourse.hibernate.org/c/hibernate-orm">Hibernate ORM</a>
<a class="ui label" href="https://discourse.hibernate.org/c/hibernate-search">Hibernate Search</a>
<a class="ui label" href="https://discourse.hibernate.org/c/hibernate-validator">Hibernate Validator</a>
<a class="ui label" href="https://discourse.hibernate.org/c/hibernate-reactive">Hibernate Reactive</a>
<a class="ui label" href="https://discourse.hibernate.org/c/hibernate-tools">Hibernate Tools</a>
</div>
+++

https://hibernate.zulipchat.com/[Chat]::
If you prefer live conversations (we do), join the Hibernate User help channel,
powered by https://zulipchat.com/[Zulip]:
+++<br />
<a class="ui mini button labeled icon primary" href="https://hibernate.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/132096-hibernate-user"><i class="icon users"></i>hibernate-user</a>

NOTE: Bear in mind that people who can help answer your questions may not even see that message for hours - be patient for a reply.

https://hibernate.atlassian.net[Issue tracker]::
If you need to report a bug or request a new feature, look for a similar one on JIRA.
If you don't find any, create a ticket.
Here are the pages dedicated to each project:
+++<br />
<div class="ui labels blue">
<a class="ui label" href="https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH">Hibernate ORM</a>
<a class="ui label" href="https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH">Hibernate Search</a>
<a class="ui label" href="https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV">Hibernate Validator</a>
<a class="ui label" href="https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-reactive/issues">Hibernate Reactive</a>
<a class="ui label" href="https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HBX">Hibernate Tools</a>
</div>
+++
+
NOTE: If you're unsure whether you found a bug or simply made a mistake,
please try to get help on Stack Overflow or on our forums first (see above).
