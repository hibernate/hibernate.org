Hibernate OGM is young and community driven.
As such the roadmap constantly evolves to reflect the users needs.
You can find a finer grained roadmap in our https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/OGM[issue tracker]
but this page is a good and concise view of where we are going.
Dates are generally omitted, we release when we are ready.

== Future releases

Describe plans for future releases.

=== Hibernate OGM 4.2

More mapping options upon demand::
Depending on user feedback, add new mapping options.

Clean query parser design::
* Fix how the field bridge is selected for a given property.
** Automatic approach
** Manual overriding option (convention based, annotation or SPI?)
* Use Hibernate ORM metadata (EntityPersister)
  to find the type of a property for HQL literal conversion
** extract this logic and reuse it for all backends

Custom types::
Offer custom types like Hibernate ORM's user type.

Continuing work on Cassandra backend::

Polish of CouchDB::
This dialect needs some love before being promoted.

Offer per session and per statement option customization::
eg for a given call, influence the quorum factor

=== Hibernate OGM 5.0

Migrate to Hibernate ORM 5::
When Hibernate ORM 5 is out, look at migrating to the new codebase.

Mapping strategies::
Rethink the default values for the mapping approaches after more user feedback.
A backward compatible mode will be kept however.

Polyglot persistence::
Offer ability to store entities into different backends.
Entities could be in either backends.


General NoSQL and query depth and breath improvements::
Continue mapping of query engine on other NoSQL
Continue coverage of breath of supported queries

Map/Reduce on queries::
Map/Reduce based resolution of subgraphs of a query

Infinispan over HotRod::
Support non library mode for Infinispan

=== Hibernate OGM Next

Migration engine::
Offer options to support transparent migrations when (non)schema has migrated.
Annotation based or API based. +
For example, one would rename a property from a to b,
the migration engine will know that, read the old value if present,
and migrate to the new schema.

Denormalization engine::
Offer ability to store data in different structures denormalized.
Let loading and queries use these denormalized versions for faster retrieval.
The goal is to offer a declarative approach
instead of the imperative approach sued usually in the NoSQL land.

Write-behind cross-backends::
Offer ability to store into two backends.
In particular, store data in a NoSQL backend and a relational database.

Use Teiid query engine for joins and aggregation::
Explore reuse of Teiid query engine for smarter queries

== Past releases

An aggregated changelog of what has happened.
We are too lazy to go back down to the history of time
so we will start at 4.0 Beta 3.

=== Hibernate OGM 4.2 CR1

Exploration of Cassandra::
Implement the Cassandra datastore and its CQL query backend.

Support for MongoDB 3 (SCRAM-SHA-1) and MongoDB replica sets::
Extended syntax for "host" setting for specifying several hosts

New built-in types for boolean mapping::
Map booleans as "Y"/"N", "T"/"F", 1/0

=== Hibernate OGM 4.2 Beta1

Error report and compensation API::
Offer the ability to collect errors on partially executed "transactions".
Offer ability to react to these errors.

Various query improvements::
* Support for collection of embeddables

=== Hibernate OGM 4.1

Performance and stabilization::
Review performance and overall choices before going final.
In particular, database round trips and query execution speed (see below).
Reuse of the data loaded between an entity and its association lookup.

Improved Neo4J navigation::
Explore label (Neo4J 2). +
Support Neo4J with ability to keep node reference for cheap navigation when resolving proxies
thus avoiding unnecessary lookups.

* Store tuple as data snapshot via IdentityMap or enhanced entity
* Use stored tuples as navigation tools instead of fetching (graph databases)

Stable mapping model::
The way data is stored is now stable.
We have ironed out the last details.

Set benchmark solution and reusable test suite with automated test::
Start exploring benchmark solution with regular tests in a CI.
Add reusable TCK for both CRUD and query support.

==== Additional query support

Query support for Neo4J::
Support JP-QL and native queries.

Query support for CouchDB::
Support JP-QL and native queries.

Move to proper OgmLoader implementations::
Discuss how to properly load objects via the OgmLoader approach.

Cache query plans::
Look at Hibernate ORM's HQLQueryPlan which essentially caches results
of a query translator which in term calls the entity loader.
A similar design or even interface result is probably possible

Various query improvements::
* Make sure flush is executed before a query.
* Support for projection

=== Hibernate OGM 4.1 Beta CR1

Additional key/value cache structure::
Store each entity type and association in a dedicated cache.
Use this strategy as default since it is more eficient and it has more natural mapping.

Improve mapping of emebedded objects, embedded ids and properties::
Represent embedded nodes as individual nodes in Neo4j.
Store emebedded id foreign keys as nested document in MongoDB.

=== Hibernate OGM 4.1 Beta 8

Optimistic locking detection::
Support optimistic locking detection for datastores which provide atomic find-and-update operations.

Performance improvements::
Reduce the amount fo round trips to the datastore.

=== Hibernate OGM 4.1 Beta 7

Support ObjectId in MongoDB::
Map object ids either directly via MongoDBâ€™s [classname]+org.bson.types.ObjectId+ type or using a +String+.

API/SPI internal split::
Clear separation among API, SPI and internal packages in preparation for the final release.

=== Hibernate OGM 4.1 Beta 6

Query improvements::
* Support polymorphic queries on datastores that don't use Hibernate Search (Neo4j and MongoDB).
* All pending changes to entities of the effected types will be flushed to the datastore in order
  to ensure queries don't return any stale data.
* Cache native queries derived from JP-QL queries.

Improve associations mapping in Neo4j::
Remove redundant properties from relationships when mapping associations in Neo4j.

Simplified version management::
Provide a BOM (Bill of Materials) for maven users.

=== Hibernate OGM 4.1 Beta 5

Conversion from JP-QL to Cypher::
Convert JP-QL queries in Cypher queris when working with Neo4j.

More natural mapping for associations in MongoDB and CouchDB::
Use a more concise representation when storing associations.

=== Hibernate OGM 4.1 Beta 4

Support for MongoDB CLI syntax::
Express native queries in MongoDB using the CLI syntax.

Improve mapping of associations in Neo4j::
In Neo4j, a bi-directional association is now mapped using a single relationship.

=== Hibernate OGM 4.1 Beta 3

Improve query support around projection and operators::
* operators =, <, <=, >, =, IN, LIKE, BETWEEN
* boolean combinations: AND, OR, NOT
* Support for simple property projections

JP-QL query support for MongoDB::
Convert JP-QL queries into MongoQL queries and run them to retrieve entities. 

Discriminator based hierarchy::
When using the single table per class strategy for the mapping of hierachies,
a column will be added to differentiate between entity types in a hierarchy.

Support for Hibernate Search mass indexing::
When using Hibernate Search in conjunction with Hibernate OGM,
you can now index entities using the MassIndexer

=== Hibernate OGM 4.1 Beta 2

New integration modules::
Add integration modules for Wildfly (ex-JBoss AS) and EAP.

=== Hibernate OGM 4.1 Beta 1

Annotation based option system::
Each datastore can use specific annotations to customize its behavior.
The user can use either annotations or a programmatic API

* offer ability for each dialect to react to metadata specific information
* programmatic and annotation based
* for different scopes: generic, type and properties
* retrofit this for MongoDB's options

CRUD support for CouchDB::
Support the CouchDB document DB to read and store entities and associations.

JPA related improvements::
Compatibility with JPA 2.1 and Hibernate ORM 4.3. +
Support for the various +EntityManager.createQuery+ methods including named queries.

Batch changes per transactions::
Offer the [classname]+GridDialect+ the option to receive a batch of operations
to execute. Some drivers are better that way and can increase the isolation level.
MongoDB is the first dialect benefiting from that support.

=== Hibernate OGM 4.0 Beta4

CRUD support for Neo4J::
Support the Neo4J Graph DB to read and store entities and associations.

Native query::
Offer the ability to pass a native backend query and bind the result to an entity.
All flexibility of the native underlying query system is available
at the cost of portability.

Use immutable metadata info to lower memory pressure::
Data passed to the [classname]+GridDialect+ are made of:

* an object specific data (id etc)
* an object type generic data (table name, column name etc)

+
The object type information could be shared to lower memory consumption
and avoid the object creation cost.

=== Hibernate OGM 4.0 Beta3

Improved query support around projection and operators::
Supported operators $$=, <, <=, >, =>, IN, LIKE, BETWEEN$$. +
Supported boolean combinations: AND, OR, NOT. +
Support for simple property projections and embedded objects.

JP-QL query support for MongoDB::
Execute JP-QL queries as MongoDB queries.

Discriminator based hierarchy::
Support for hierarchy of classes using a discriminator column as defined by JPA.

JBoss AS 7 integration module::
Add Hibernate OGM support by copying the module in the JBoss AS module repository.

Support for Hibernate Search mass indexing::
Mass indexing now works out of the box when using Hibernate OGM.

Upgrade to Hibernate ORM 4.2 and JPA 2.1::
