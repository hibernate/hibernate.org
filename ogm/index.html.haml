          === Many NoSQL stores, one standard way to access them

          Hibernate Object/Grid Mapper (OGM) provides Java Persistence (JPA) support for NoSQL solutions.
          It reuses Hibernate ORM's engine but persists entities into a NoSQL datastore instead of a relational database.

          We know you have questions, we'll answer them in the link:faq/[FAQ].

          === Wide range of backends

          OGM talks to NoSQL backends via store-specific dialects. Currently there is support for

          * _Key/Value_: Infinispan; Ehcache; Redis (tech preview)
          * _Document_: MongoDB; CouchDB (tech preview)
          * _Graph_: Neo4j
          * _Wide-column_: Cassandra (tech preview)

          Your favorite NoSQL store isn't listed here? We'd love to get link:/ogm/contribute[your help] for adding it.

          === Rich query capabilities

          Hibernate OGM supports several ways for searching entities and returning them as Hibernate _managed objects_:

          * _JP-QL queries_ (we convert them into a native backend query)
          * datastore specific _native queries_
          * _full-text queries_, using Hibernate Search as indexing engine

          === And more...

          * When JPA isn't enough, Hibernate OGM extends it with family-specific and product-specific options.
          That way, the power of the backend is at your fingertips.
          All that in a type-safe way.
          * Mixing several NoSql datastores in one application, e.g. use Neo4j for your friendship graph and MongoDB for your blog posts. Or mix NoSQL and relational databases.
          * Support for implicit data migrations upon data load (later)
          * Denormalize data declaratively for faster retrieval (later)
