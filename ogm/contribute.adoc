[[ogm-howtocontribute]]

Hibernate OGM is a young project.
The code, the direction and the documentation are all in flux
and being built by the community.
Join and help us shape it!

[[ogm-howtocontribute-help]]

== How to get help

First of all, make sure to read this reference documentation.
This is the most comprehensive formal source of information.
Of course, it is not perfect:
feel free to come and ask for help,
comment or propose improvements in our
https://forum.hibernate.org/viewforum.php?f=31[Hibernate OGM forum].

You can also:

* open bug reports in https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/OGM[JIRA]
* propose improvements on the
  http://www.hibernate.org/community/mailinglists[development mailing list]
* join us on IRC to discuss developments and improvements
  (+#hibernate-dev+ on +freenode.net+;
  you need to be registered on freenode:
  the room does not accept "anonymous" users).

== How to contribute

Welcome!

There are many ways to contribute:

* report bugs in https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/OGM[JIRA]
* give feedback in the forum, IRC or the development mailing list
* improve the documentation
* fix bugs or contribute new features
* propose and code a datastore dialect for your favorite NoSQL engine


Hibernate OGM's code is available on GitHub at
https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm.

=== How to build Hibernate OGM

Hibernate OGM uses Git and Maven 3,
make sure to have both installed on your system.

Clone the git repository from GitHub:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm
cd hibernate-ogm
----

Run maven

[source]
----
mvn clean install -s settings-example.xml
----

[NOTE]
====
Note that Hibernate OGM uses artifacts from the Maven repository hosted by JBoss.
Make sure to either use the [code]+-s settings-example.xml+ option
or adjust your [filename]+$$~/.m2/settings.xml$$+
according to the descriptions available
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/MavenGettingStarted-Users[on this jboss.org wiki page].
====

[NOTE]
====
Note that for running the test suite against separately installed MongoDB and CouchDB servers
their host name must be specified via an environment variable.
See the sections below for the details.
====

To speed things up, there are several options for skipping parts of the build.
To run the minimum project build without integration tests, documentation and distribution execute:

[source]
----
mvn clean install -DskipITs -DskipDocs -DskipDistro -s settings-example.xml
----

The following sections describe these options in more detail.

==== Integration tests

Integration tests per default download the WildFly application server,
unpack the modules in it and run the tests using Arquillian.
You can skip integration tests by specifying the `skipITs` property:

[source]
----
mvn clean install -DskipITs -s settings-example.xml
----

===== MongoDB

For executing the tests in the _mongodb_ and _integrationtest/mongodb_ modules, the
https://github.com/joelittlejohn/embedmongo-maven-plugin[embedmongo-maven-plugin] is used.
It downloads the MongoDB distribution, extracts it, starts a _mongod_ process and shuts it down
after test execution.

If required, you can configure the port to which the MongoDB instance binds to (by default 27018)
and the target directory for the extracted binary (defaults to
_${project.build.directory}/embeddedMongoDb/extracted_) like this:

[source]
----
mvn clean install -s settings-example.xml -DembeddedMongoDbTempDir=<my-temp-dir> -DembeddedMongoDbPort=<my-port>
----

To work with a separately installed MongoDB instance instead, specify the `useExternalMongoDb` property:

[source]
----
mvn clean install -s settings-example.xml -DuseExternalMongoDb
----

This assumes MongoDB to be installed on `localhost`, using the default port and no authentication.
If you work with different settings, configure the required properties in hibernate.properties
(for the tests in _mongodb_)
and/or the environment variables `MONGODB_HOSTNAME` `MONGODB_PORT` `MONGODB_USERNAME`
`MONGODB_PASSWORD` (for the tests in _integrationtest/mongodb_)
prior to running the tests:

[source]
----
export MONGODB_HOSTNAME=mongodb-machine
export MONGODB_PORT=1234
export MONGODB_USERNAME=someUsername
export MONGODB_PASSWORD=someP@ssw0rd
mvn clean install -s settings-example.xml
----

===== CouchDB

For running the tests in the _couchdb_ module an installed CouchDB server is required.
Specify its host name by setting the environment variable `COUCHDB_HOSTNAME` prior to running
the test suite:

[source]
----
export COUCHDB_HOSTNAME=couchdb-machine
----

If this variable is not set, the _couchdb_ module still will be compiled and packaged but the
tests will be skipped.

==== Documentation

The documentation is built by default as part of the project build. You can skip it by specifying
the `skipDocs` property:

[source]
----
mvn clean install -DskipDocs -s settings-example.xml
----

If you just want to build the documentation, run it from the _documentation/manual_ subdirectory.

For rapid documentation testing, you can limit the generated format to html to speed up the process

[source]
----
mvn clean install -f documentation/manual/pom.xml -s settings-example.xml -Djdocbook.format=html_single
----

==== Distribution

The distribution bundle is built by default as part of the project build. You can skip it by
specifying the `skipDistro` property:

[source]
----
mvn clean install -DskipDistro -s settings-example.xml
----

[TIP]
====
Make sure to check the https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm/blob/master/readme.md[readme.md]
in the source root directory for further build options.

=== How are the tests structured?

==== Core tests

There are two types of tests in core:

1. Unit tests for stuff in core itself
2. And the "backendtck" which are high-level (i.e. Session/EM-level) tests and which are executed
for all backends. This is our backend TCK.

To run a specific test against a specific store in Eclipse, simplest is to use the
`<StoreName>BackendTckHelper` class to run the test.

For instance, if you want to run the `BuiltInTypeTest` test for Neo4j, open the `Neo4JBackendTckHelper`
class in your IDE and make the `@ClasspathSuite.ClassnameFilters` annotation look like:

[source]
----
@ClasspathSuite.ClassnameFilters({ ".*BuiltInTypeTest" })
----

Then simply run `Neo4JBackendTckHelper` as a JUnit test in your IDE.

==== Tests specific to a dialect

As for the unit tests specific to a dialect, you can just run the test as a JUnit test in your IDE.

=== Code organization

Packages are organized with the SPI/impl split at the lowest level.
SPI is geared towards grid dialect implementors.
The split is not complete yet, as some parts of "our" dialects refer to "impl" classes from core.
Anything not "spi" or "impl" is public API.

=== How to contribute code effectively

The best way to share code is to fork the Hibernate OGM repository on GitHub,
create a branch and open a pull request when you are ready.
Make sure to rebase your pull request
on the latest version of the master branch before offering it.

Here are a couple of approaches the team follows:

* We do small independent commits for each code change.
  In particular, we do not mix stylistic code changes (import, typos, etc)
  and new features in the same commit.
* Commit messages follow this convention:
  the JIRA issue number, a short commit summary, an empty line,
  a longer description if needed.
  Make sure to limit line length to 80 characters, even at this day and age
  it makes for more readable commit comments.
[source]
----
OGM-123 Summary of commit operation

Optional details on the commit
and a longer description can be
added here.
----

* A pull request can contain several commits but should be self contained:
  include the implementation, its unit tests, its documentation
  and javadoc changes if needed.
* All commits are proposed via pull requests
  and reviewed by another member of the team
  before being pushed to the reference repository.
  That's right, we never commit directly upstream without code review.
