You've got a question burning you? We might have the answer for you.

== Using Hibernate OGM

=== Why is there so few entries in this FAQ?

Because Hibernate OGM is so well designed that you get it right away.

More seriously, this is a work in progress.
If you have questions that you feel should be there,
link:/community/[contact us].

=== How does Hibernate OGM handle transactions?

Like Hibernate ORM, Hibernate OGM is orthogonal and agnostic to transactions,
but integrates the flush event to them when possible.

Make sure to demarcate your transaction either via your application container
or via the Hibernate OGM transaction demarcation methods.
The reference documentation details how to set up Hibernate OGM
in various transaction environments.

Note that even if your datastore does not support transactions,
we recommend you use transaction demarcations with Hibernate OGM
to trigger the flush operation transparently (on commit).
But do not consider rollback as a possibility, this wonâ€™t work.

=== How can I query?

There are three main methods:

* using Hibernate Search as indexing engine and use full-text queries
* using JP-QL (we convert it into a native backend query)
* pass a native backend query and bind it to the entity

The reference documentation details the various options.

== Developers of Hibernate OGM

=== How to skip some tests while in the development of a new +Dialect+?

To skip all tests (from the core suite) for example related to associations,
add this configuration to the Maven Surefire plugin:

[source,xml]
----
<excludes>
    <exclude>**/associations/**/*Test.java</exclude>
</excludes>
----

So the plugin configuration can look like:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
            <configuration>
                <excludes>
                    <exclude>**/associations/**/*Test.java</exclude>
                </excludes>
                <forkMode>once</forkMode>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
----
