=== Jakarta JPA 2.2 and 3.0

Hibernate ORM 5.5 adds new artifacts with the artifact id suffix "-jakarta" like `hibernate-core-jakarta`.

The `hibernate-core-jakarta` artifact implements the Jakarta JPA 3.0 specification,
while the `hibernate-core` artifact still implements the Jakarta JPA 2.2 specification.

The artifacts are both certified as compatible implementations:

* https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/2.2/#compatible-implementations
* https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.0/#compatible-implementations

Please note that the Jakarta artifacts are still considered experimental.

=== Bytecode enhancement

The bytecode enhancement configuration was adapted to turn on enhancement-as-proxy by default and remove the switch for configuring this.
