=== Jakarta JPA work in progress

Hibernate ORM 5.5.0.Alpha1 adds new artifacts with the name suffix "-jakarta" like hibernate-core-jakarta.
These artifacts are currently work in progress, but will eventually provide support for Jakarta JPA 3.0.

=== Bytecode enhancement

The bytecode enhancement configuration was adapted to turn on enhancement-as-proxy by default and remove the switch for configuring this.
