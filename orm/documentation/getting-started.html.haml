  == Building
  
  For developers wanting to build from source, see the README.md file in the root of the project source.
  
  == Contributing (pull requests)
  
  For developers wanting to contribute back fixes/improvements, see the CONTRIBUTING.md file in the root of the project source  .
  
  == Using
  
  For developers wanting to use Hibernate ORM in their projects, the best approach is to use it as Maven dependency.
  
  === System Requirements
  
  Hibernate ORM requires Java 6 or higher.
  
  === Via Maven Repository
  
  The Hibernate ORM artifacts can be found in Maven's central repository but are released first in the JBoss maven repository.
  So it's not a requirement but we recommend to add this repository to your +settings.xml+ file
  (see also Maven Getting Started for more details).
  
  To use Hibernate ORM in your own project you just need to name a dependency on it in your project:
  
  [source,xml]
  [subs="verbatim,attributes"]
  .From Maven
  ----
  <dependency>
     <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
     <artifactId>hibernate-core</artifactId>
     <version>{latest_stable}</version>
  </dependency>
  ----
  
  From Gradle:
  
  [source]
  [subs="verbatim,attributes"]
  .From Gradle
  ----
  org.hibernate:hibernate-core:{latest_stable}
  ----
  
  For projects using JPA, the artifact to reference is `hibernate-entitymanager` instead of `hibernate-core`.
