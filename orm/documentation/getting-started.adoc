This page lists just the basic information needed to get up and running with Hibernate ORM 4.3.
More thorough information is presented in the Getting Started Guide in the link:/orm/documentation[documentation].

== System Requirements

Java 6 or higher (building Hibernate from source requires JDK 7 due to a bug in the JDK 6 compiler).


== Dependency Management

It is highly recommended to consume Hibernate ORM artifacts through a dependency management tool.  The artifacts
can be found in Maven's central repository but are released first in the
https://community.jboss.org/wiki/MavenRepository[JBoss maven repository].  Snapshots are only pushed to the
JBoss snapshot repository, so if you want to use SNAPSHOT versions be sure to add the JBoss snapshot repository
properly according to your build tool of choice.

The main Hibernate ORM artifact is named hibernate-core.  If you wish to use JPA support, you would instead name
hibernate-entitymanager.

[TIP]
====
There are also a number of optional artifacts based on what specific features you wich to use.  These
are discussed in the Getting Started Guide.
====

To use Hibernate ORM in your own project you just need to name a dependency on it in your project.
