We always have new ideas to solve data related problems.
You will find some of these experiments here.

== Hibernate Shards

[role="ui message warning"]
Hibernate Shards has not been kept up to date with the latest Hibernate ORM versions.
Some community members have interest in making it catch up.
If you are interested, link:/community/[contact us].

You can't always put all your relational data in a single relational database:

* Sometimes you simply have too much data.
* Sometimes you have a distributed deployment architecture.
* Sometimes the lawyers say "no" (or more likely, "NOOO!").

Whatever your reasons,
talking to multiple relational databases inevitably complicates the development of your application.

Hibernate Shards is a framework that is designed to encapsulates
and minimize this complexity by adding support for horizontal partitioning to Hibernate Core.

=== Key features

Standard Hibernate programming model::
Hibernate Shards allows you to continue using the Hibernate APIs you know and love:
+SessionFactory+, +Session+, +Criteria+, +Query+.
If you already know how to use Hibernate, you already know how to use Hibernate Shards.
Flexible sharding strategies::
Distribute data across your shards any way you want.
Use one of the default strategies we provide or plug in your own application-specific logic.
Support for virtual shards::
Think your sharding strategy is never going to change? Think again.
Adding new shards and redistributing your data is one of the toughest operational challenges you will face
once you've deployed your shard-aware application.
Hibernate Sharding supports virtual shards, a feature designed to simplify the process of resharding your data.
